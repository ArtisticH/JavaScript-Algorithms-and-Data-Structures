# Functional Programming
In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.

### Learn About Functional Programming
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: `INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT`.  
- Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change  
- (전역 변수처럼 프로그램 상태에 의존하지 않음)
- Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output
- Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

```
// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4TeamFCC = getTea(40);
console.log(tea4TeamFCC);
// Only change code above this line
```

### Understand Functional Programming Terminology

The FCC Team had a mood swing and now wants two types of tea: green tea and black tea.  
General Fact: Client mood swings are pretty common.

With that information, we'll need to revisit the `getTea` function from last challenge to handle various tea requests.  
We can modify `getTea` to accept a function as a parameter to be able to change the type of tea it prepares.  
This makes getTea more flexible, and gives the programmer more control when client requests change.

But first, let's cover some functional terminology:  

Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in `filter`, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called *first class* functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value, are called *higher order functions*.

When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a *lambda*.
```
// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27);
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13);
// Only change code above this line

console.log(
  tea4GreenTeamFCC,
  tea4BlackTeamFCC
);
```

### 🌟Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code
Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs. But before we get there, let's look at an imperative approach to programming to highlight where you may have issues.

In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.

Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a `for` loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.

In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the `for` loop mentioned above, you could call the `map` method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.

Consider the scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.

A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open. The titles of each open site in each Window object is held in an array. After working in the browser (opening new tabs, merging windows, and closing tabs), you want to print the tabs that are still open. Closed tabs are removed from the array and new tabs (for simplicity) get added to the end of it.

The code editor shows an implementation of this functionality with functions for `tabOpen()`, `tabClose()`, and `join()`. The array tabs is part of the Window object that stores the name of the open pages.
